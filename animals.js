      description: `According to wikipedia: The giraffe's chief distinguishing
                    characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its
                    horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. It is
                    classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest
                    extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from
                    Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger
                    in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit
                    savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits,
                    and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which
                    they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.`

      description: `According to wikipedia: The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat
                    of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a
                    muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears;
                    and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
                    dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a
                    prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called
                    prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related
                    females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt
                    together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an
                    apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
                    opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions
                    typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.`

      description: `According to wikipedia: Zebras are primarily grazers and can
                    subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly
                    by lions, and typically flee when threatened but also bite and
                    kick. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains
                    and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an
                    adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and
                    their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live alone or in
                    loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult
                    females mate only with their harem stallion, while male
                    Grévy's zebras establish territories which attract females and
                    the species is promiscuous. Zebras communicate with various
                    vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions. Social
                    grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain
                    zebras.`

      description: `According to wikipedia: Elephants are scattered throughout
                    sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are
                    found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests,
                    deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near
                    water when it is accessible. They are considered to be
                    keystone species, due to their impact on their environments.
                    Elephants have a fission-fusion society, in which multiple
                    family groups come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend
                    to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with
                    her calves or several related females with offspring. The
                    leader of a female group, usually the oldest cow, is known as
                    the matriarch.`

      description: `According to wikipedia: Water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), also
                    called the domestic water buffalo or Asian water buffalo, is a
                    large bovid originating in the Indian subcontinent and
                    Southeast Asia. Today, it is also found in Italy, the Balkans,
                    Australia, North America, South America and some African
                    countries.[1] Two extant types of water buffalo are
                    recognized, based on morphological and behavioural criteria:
                    the river buffalo of the Indian subcontinent and further west
                    to the Balkans, Egypt and Italy and the swamp buffalo, found
                    from Assam in the west through Southeast Asia to the Yangtze
                    valley of China in the east.[1][2]`
